# CSCI 2270 Final Project

**Summary**

This project will take stats from Kobe Bryant's NBA career and insert it into a Binary Tree sorted based on points per season.  The data is read from a text file and will be put into the tree based on the amount of points scored per season.  Once the tree is built, the user will have 3 options.  1. Calculating the total points Kobe Bryant has scored in his career.  2. Ranking the seasons based on certain stats (points, average points, and three point percentage). 3. Viewing all the stats of a specific season.

**How to Run**

This project was created in Xcode but compiled and ran through terminal.  
* Put all files in the same directory.  
* Navigate to the directory in terminal
* Put in this code: 
```
g++ -o test main.cpp statTree.cpp
```
* Once it is compiled, run this code: 
```
./test KBStats.txt
```
* From there, you will be able to use the program

**Dependencies**

All files needed are provided in this repository.

**System Requirements**

This was written in Xcode on a Macbook Pro.  It runs using Unix commands in the Terminal.  I am not sure if it will work on windows but it should work on both OSX and Linux.
