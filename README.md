# CSCI 2270 Final Project

**Summary**

This project will take stast from Kobe Bryant's NBA career and insert it into a Binary Tree based on points per season.  The data is read from a CSV file and will be put into the tree based on the amount of points scored per season.  Once the tree is built, the user will have the option to get more details on a particular season.  These details include points scored, games played, games started, average points per game, Field goal percentage, 3 point percentage, 2 point percentage, and free thrown percentage.

**How to Run**
This project was created in Xcode but compiled and ran through terminal.  
* Put all files in the same directory.  
* Navigate to the directory in terminal
* Put in this code: g++ -o test (INSERT FILES HERE)
* Once it is compiled, run this code: ./test KBStats.csv
* From there, you will be able to use the program

**Dependencies**
All files needed are provided in this repository.

**System Requirements**
This was written in Xcode on a Macbook Pro.  It runs using Unix commands in the Terminal.  I am not sure if it will work on windows but it should work on both OSX and Linux.
