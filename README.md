# CSCI 2270 Final Project

**Summary**

This project will take stast from Kobe Bryant's NBA career and insert it into a Binary Tree based on points per season.  The data is read from a CSV file and will be put into the tree based on the amount of points scored per season.  Once the tree is built, the user will have the option to get more details on a particular season.  These details include points scored, games played, games started, average points per game, Field goal percentage, 3 point percentage, 2 point percentage, and free thrown percentage.
